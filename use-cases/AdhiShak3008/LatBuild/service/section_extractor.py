"""
section_extractor.py
Extract clean prose from a section for sending to SuperDocs.

Responsibilities:
- Produce clean plain text from a Section's content blocks
- Report word count and estimated character budget
- Preserve non-content element positions (figures, tables never touched)

SuperDocs receives ONLY clean prose. It has no idea the text came from a PDF,
which page it came from, or what columns it occupied. That is intentional.
